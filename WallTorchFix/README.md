Greatly improves the performance of wall mounted torches by having new and more efficient flame particle effects. Rough performance gain is 600%.

Just by placing a few torches in the game, you can immediately see your frame rate dropping. With just 32x vanilla torches next to each other I had my frame rate drop from 60 to 40 fps. With the new, optimized torch I can place 200 of them to get my frame rates drop to a similar value around 40 fps, that's roughly 600% better performance compared to vanilla.
